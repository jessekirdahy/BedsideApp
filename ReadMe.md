I want a simple, full-screen iPad-friendly web app for a nursing home resident with cognitive/motor limitations. It should display large tappable photo tiles of key contacts that use tel: or facetime: links to initiate calls. It should embed a shared Google Calendar (agenda view) and a Google Doc or other editable care log for family notes. The layout should be minimalist, touch-optimized, and accessible (large font, high contrast, no scrolling required). It will be launched from the home screen using “Add to Home Screen” in Safari, and should work offline if possible.
